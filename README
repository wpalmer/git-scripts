These scripts are quick & dirty hacks, made public because there is no
reason for them to be private.

To the extent which I am permitted by law, I release these scripts into
the public domain. I do not consider them suitable for inclusion into
the main git project (otherwise they would be sent as patches, not
dumped lamely into a public repository), but if someone else cleans them
up, I will not act to prevent their inclusion.
